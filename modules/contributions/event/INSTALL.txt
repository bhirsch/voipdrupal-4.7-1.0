Requirements
------------

This module requires Drupal 4.6 or higher.

Installation
------------

1. Create the SQL tables. This depends a little on your system, but the
   most common method is:
     mysql -u username -ppassword drupal < event.mysql

2. Place the event module with all its files under modules/event.

3. Enable the module in admin >> site configuration >> modules 
   and set the module settings to your liking in 
   admin >> site configuration >> modules >> event.

4. You must then enable one or more node types to be used with the
   event system. You can do this by going to admin/node/configure/types
   and selecting a node type from the list. If the event calendar is 
   installed properly you should see a section called 'Show in event calendar:'
   with three options below it:

    * None: This content type will not be associated with the events calendar.
    * All views: This content type will be available for display on all calendar
      views, including with other events.
    * Only in views for this type: This content type will only appear in calendar
      views specific to this type and never with other events.

   'All views' enables the node type will appear on the calendar with all other
   node types set to 'All views'.
   'Only in views for this type' will display the type only on its own calendar.
   Use if you dont want a type appearing with other types.
   'None' disables a type from appearing on the calendar.

   Once a node type is enabled in this way, event will inject date input fields
   on that node type's edit form and display them on the calendar views.
   
   It is recommended that you install flexinode module and create event types for this purpose,
   so you do not have to use core node types for the calendar system.
